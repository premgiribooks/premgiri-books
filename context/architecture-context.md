# Architecture Context

## Architecture Style

Premgiri Books ERP follows an **Offline-First Modular Monolith Architecture**.

The application is designed to run completely on a local computer or local office network without requiring an internet connection.

All business operations including Accounting, GST, Inventory, Billing, Purchasing, Reports, and Printing are executed locally.

Cloud connectivity is optional and reserved for future capabilities such as cloud backup, GST portal integration, mobile applications, and synchronization.

The system is divided into independent business modules that share common business engines instead of duplicating business logic.

# Core Business Principles

## Voucher Driven

Every financial transaction must generate accounting vouchers.

Examples

- Sales Invoice
- Purchase Invoice
- Receipt Voucher
- Payment Voucher
- Contra Voucher
- Journal Voucher
- Sales Return
- Purchase Return

Financial reports must always be generated from voucher entries.

---

## Document Driven

Every transaction is treated as a business document.

Lifecycle

```
Draft
    ↓
Saved
    ↓
Approved
    ↓
Posted
    ↓
Voucher Generated
    ↓
Locked
    ↓
Cancelled (Optional)
```

---

## Engine Driven

Business rules must exist only inside business engines.

User Interface components must never calculate:

- GST
- Selling Price
- Margin
- Ledger Entries
- Inventory Movement

Screens only request services from the engines.

---

# Core Engines

## Voucher Engine

Responsibilities

- Double Entry Accounting
- Voucher Posting
- Journal Entries
- Ledger Posting
- Trial Balance
- Profit & Loss
- Balance Sheet
- Cash Book
- Bank Book
- Audit Trail

---

## Pricing Engine

Responsibilities

- Latest Purchase Cost — the Engine owns the *selection rule* only
  (`src/engines/pricing/purchase-cost-sync.ts`, 95-purchase-price-sync.md):
  which line's cost becomes the new value, given a posted document's lines.
  It has no IO. Reading `Product.purchasePrice` at resolve time
  (`pricing-engine.ts`) is unchanged; *persisting* a new value plus its
  history trail is the `product-purchase-price-history` module's job,
  called from Purchase Invoice posting and Purchase Order confirmation.
  Resolves the tension `30-pricing-engine.md:69-70` originally left open
  ("Purchase Invoice overwrites it later" — never built until spec 95).
- Margin Profiles
- Price Lists
- Customer Pricing
- Dealer Pricing
- Wholesale Pricing
- Discount Rules
- Selling Price Calculation

---

## Inventory Engine

Responsibilities

- Stock In
- Stock Out
- Warehouse Management
- Stock Transfer
- Stock Adjustment
- Physical Verification
- Stock Ledger
- Stock Valuation
- Batch Tracking (opt-in per product; `StockTransaction.batchId` optional, required only when the product is batch-tracked — see `50-batch-tracking.md`)
- Serial Number Tracking (opt-in per product, mutually exclusive with Batch Tracking; `StockTransaction.serialId` optional, required only when the product is serial-tracked, and that line's quantity must equal exactly 1; `SerialNumber` is a static identity catalog with no stored status column — status/current warehouse are always derived from the serial's own movement history via `deriveSerialStatus` — see `51-serial-number-tracking.md`)

---

## GST Engine

Responsibilities

- GST Calculation
- CGST
- SGST
- IGST
- CESS
- HSN Summary
- GST Registers
- GSTR-1
- GSTR-3B

---

## Reporting Engine

Responsibilities

- Dashboard
- Financial Reports
- Sales Reports
- Purchase Reports
- Inventory Reports
- GST Reports
- Excel Export
- PDF Export

---

# Module Boundaries

## Authentication

Responsible for

- Login
- User Management
- Roles
- Permissions
- Session Management

---

## Company

Responsible for

- Company Details
- Branches
- Financial Years
- Banks
- Company Settings

---

## Masters

Responsible for

- Customers
- Suppliers
- Products
- Categories
- Brands
- Units
- Warehouses
- Employees
- HSN Codes
- GST Rates
- Price Lists
- Margin Profiles

Masters never generate accounting entries.

---

## Sales

Responsible for

- Quotations
- Sales Orders
- Delivery Challans
- Sales Invoices
- Sales Returns

Sales module communicates only through

- Pricing Engine
- Inventory Engine
- Voucher Engine
- GST Engine

---

## Purchase

Responsible for

- Purchase Orders
- Goods Receipt
- Purchase Invoices
- Purchase Returns

Purchase communicates only through shared business engines.

**Recorded exception (95-purchase-price-sync.md, 2026-09-22):** Purchase
Invoice posting and Purchase Order confirmation each write one specific
field of Product master data (`Product.purchasePrice`) as a posting side
effect — but only ever through the shared
`productPurchasePriceHistoryService.syncFromPurchaseDocument()` call, never
by touching the `Product` table directly. This satisfies "Modules
communicate through shared services, never by directly modifying another
module's data" precisely because it goes through a shared service; it is
not a boundary violation, but is called out here because it is the first
case of Purchase writing (not just reading) Product-owned data. This is
also a deliberate deviation from what `42-purchase-orders.md:156-163` and
`30-pricing-engine.md:69-70` originally documented (only a Purchase Invoice
was expected to ever write back, never a Purchase Order) — per explicit
user instruction, both documents now participate, whichever posts/confirms
most recently wins.

---

## Inventory

Responsible for

- Opening Stock
- Stock Adjustment
- Stock Transfer
- Warehouse Operations
- Physical Verification

Inventory module never creates accounting entries directly.

---

## Accounting

Responsible for

- Receipt Voucher
- Payment Voucher
- Contra Voucher
- Journal Voucher
- Ledger Inquiry

Accounting uses Voucher Engine.

---

## GST

Responsible for

- GST Reports
- GST Registers
- Return Generation

GST module never updates accounting directly.

---

## Employee

Responsible for

- Employee Master
- Attendance
- Salary
- Payroll

---

## Reports

Responsible only for presenting information.

Reports never modify business data.

---

# Data Storage

## PostgreSQL Database

Stores

- Companies
- Users
- Roles
- Customers
- Suppliers
- Products
- Inventory
- Vouchers
- Voucher Entries
- Ledgers
- GST Data
- Employees
- Business Settings

---

## Local File Storage

Stores

- Invoice PDFs
- Company Logos
- Product Images
- Excel Imports
- Excel Exports
- Backup Files
- Attachments

Database stores only file references.

---

# Offline Strategy

Premgiri Books ERP is designed to function completely offline.

No internet connection is required for

- Login
- Sales
- Purchase
- Inventory
- Accounting
- GST Calculation
- Reports
- Invoice Printing
- Barcode Printing
- Customer Management
- Supplier Management
- Backup

Internet is required only for future services.

---

# Security Model

- Local User Authentication
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Company-Level Isolation
- Branch-Level Permissions
- Audit Logs
- Soft Delete
- Daily Automatic Backup
- Future Database Encryption

---

# Multi-Tenant & Governance Architecture

This section merges the permanent decisions from
`context/feature-specs/ai-architecture-decisions.md` (v1.0) into this
document, per that file's own precedence rule ("if any feature specification
conflicts with this document, this document takes precedence" — refers to
`ai-architecture-decisions.md` itself). Where the current implementation
does not yet match a decision below, it is called out explicitly in
**Known Implementation Gaps** rather than silently assumed compliant.

## Tenant Isolation Rule

Every database query for a business entity must scope data using the
authenticated session's company context, never a client-supplied value.

Correct

```
where: { companyId: currentCompany.id }
```

Never

```
where: { companyId: request.companyId }
```

Every repository in this codebase that reads or writes a specific business
record already re-verifies `companyId` matches the requesting user's own
company (treating a cross-company id as "not found," never leaking
existence) — established by `user-repository.ts`/`user-service.ts` and
followed by every module since (`ledger-groups`, `ledgers`,
`bank-accounts`).

## User Hierarchy

Three conceptual levels, now fully implemented (not just documented) per
`context/feature-specs/architecture-Migration-Super-Admin-Administration.md`
and its
`architecture-Migration-Super-Admin-Administration-Implementation-Plan.md`,
completed 2026-07-13:

- **Super Admin** — `User.userType === "PLATFORM"`, has no `companyId`/
  `roleId`. Not a Role (Permanent Architecture Principle 9) — determined
  purely by `userType`. Creates/activates/deactivates companies, creates
  the first Company Admin, resets Company Admin passwords, sees every
  company. Gated by the single hardcoded check `assertSuperAdmin()`
  (`src/lib/current-user.ts`) — the *only* hardcoded identity check left
  in the app.
- **Company Admin** — `User.userType === "COMPANY"`, holding that
  company's `isSystemDefined`/`isProtected` "Company Admin" role (granted
  every catalog permission). Manages users, roles, and all data within one
  company; can never access another company or reach `/administration`.
  Gated the same way every other Company-side capability is: real
  `assertPermission()` checks, never a role-name compare (Principle 1/2).
- **Company Users** — Accountant, Sales, Purchase, Store Manager, Employee,
  or custom roles, permissioned through RBAC, scoped to one company.

## User Assignment — Target Model vs. Current Implementation

`ai-architecture-decisions.md` specifies users are mapped to companies
through a `CompanyUser` join table (`User → CompanyUser → Company`) rather
than a direct `companyId` on `User`, to support multi-company consultants,
auditors, and shared users.

**Current implementation still diverges from this**: `User.companyId` is a
direct field (now nullable, to support `PLATFORM` users with no company at
all — see Known Implementation Gaps item 1, still deferred). `Role` **is**
now scoped per company (`Role.companyId`, required) — every company has its
own private clone of the 6 reserved default roles, seeded by
`TenantBootstrapService` at company-creation time; `Permission` remains a
global capability-definition catalog (module x action pairs), which is
correct — it's not tenant data, only `Role`/`RolePermission` needed
scoping.

## Active Company Context

```
User → Company Selection → Financial Year Selection → Branch Selection → Dashboard
```

Unchanged for `COMPANY` users. A `PLATFORM` user never enters this flow at
all — `getCurrentCompany()`/`getCurrentFinancialYear()` short-circuit to
`null` for them before any cookie read or DB query (Permanent Architecture
Principle 5), and `src/proxy.ts` redirects them straight to
`/administration` on every route outside that tree (and `/profile`, shared
by both user types). Session stores `userId`/`userType`; `companyId`/
`financialYearId`/`branchId` remain cookie-based, not session-embedded (an
earlier, independent 2026-07-13 decision — recorded in
`context/progress-tracker.md` — not reversed by this migration).

## Company Initialization

Creating a company is an atomic transaction. Per
`ai-architecture-decisions.md`, creation should initialize: Company,
Company Admin, Default Financial Year, Company Settings, Default Ledger
Groups, Default Voucher Types, Default Roles, Default Permissions — with a
full rollback if any step fails.

**Current implementation now matches this closely**:
`companyService.createCompany()` (Super-Admin-only,
`src/modules/company/services/company-service.ts`) creates the `Company`
row, then `tenantBootstrapService.bootstrapTenant()`
(`src/modules/administration/services/tenant-bootstrap-service.ts`) — the
single owner of company initialization (Principle 4) — seeds that
company's 6 roles + their permissions, the Financial Year, the 23-group
Ledger Group skeleton, and the default "Cash" Ledger, then the Company
Admin `User` row is created, all inside one `prisma.$transaction`. Default
Voucher Types still do not exist (the Voucher Engine is not implemented).

## Authorization Flow

Every mutation must follow:

```
Authenticate → Resolve User Type
  → PLATFORM: assertSuperAdmin() → Execute
  → COMPANY: Resolve Company Context → Check Permission → Execute → Write Audit Log
```

`assertPermission(user, module, action)` after `getCurrentCompanyUser()` is
enforced end-to-end for every Company-side mutation, including the ones
that used to hardcode a role-name check (Company/Company Settings,
Financial Year, Users, Roles/Permissions) — see Known Implementation Gaps
item 3 for the scope of `AuditLog` writes (narrow, not universal).

## Repository Rules

Every repository automatically filters by `companyId`, and none perform
authorization themselves (Permanent Architecture Principle 3 — that
branching lives in Services only; repositories never check
`userType`/`PLATFORM`/`COMPANY`). The two Platform-only cross-company
exceptions (`userRepository.findAllCompanyAdmins()`/`setActiveById()`, for
the Administration module's Company Admins screen) are gated by
`assertSuperAdmin()` one layer up, in `platform-user-service.ts`, never in
the repository.

## Known Implementation Gaps vs. `ai-architecture-decisions.md`

Recorded per this project's precedence rule (record a documentation/code
conflict before changing code) rather than fixed unilaterally, since each
is a cross-cutting change spanning authentication, every existing module,
or both — out of scope for a single-module fix and requiring its own
scoped feature spec:

1. **User↔Company mapping**: still direct `User.companyId` (now nullable,
   for `PLATFORM` users), not a `CompanyUser` join table. Migrating to a
   real join table (for multi-company consultants/auditors/shared users)
   touches auth, sessions, and every module that reads `user.companyId` —
   remains its own scoped effort, not attempted by the Super Admin
   migration.
2. ~~Role/Permission are global, not per-company~~ — **resolved
   2026-07-13**. `Role.companyId` is now required; every company has its
   own private clone of the 6 reserved default roles, seeded by
   `TenantBootstrapService`. `Permission` correctly remains global (a
   capability-definition catalog, not tenant data).
3. **Audit Logging remains narrow, not universal.** A new `AuditLog` model
   exists (2026-07-13) but its write path covers only the 5 Administration-
   side tenant-lifecycle events the Super Admin migration introduced
   (Company Created, Company Admin Created, Company
   Activated/Deactivated, Company Admin Password Reset) —
   `auditLogService.record()`,
   `src/modules/administration/services/audit-log-service.ts`. No other
   module (Ledger Groups, Ledger Master, Bank Management, Users, Roles,
   Company Settings) writes an audit trail entry yet; a general retrofit
   remains a separate, larger effort.
4. **`createdBy`/`updatedBy` are not present on any business table** —
   every table has `createdAt`/`updatedAt` but not the actor who made the
   change. `AuditLog.actorUserId` covers this for the 5 events it records;
   every other table still has no way to attribute historical writes.
   `ProductPurchasePriceHistory.changedByUserId`
   (95-purchase-price-sync.md) is a second narrow exception, scoped only to
   automatic `Product.purchasePrice` changes — still not a general retrofit.
5. ~~Platform (Super Admin) vs. Company (Company Admin/Company Users) is
   not yet a real distinction anywhere except the schema~~ — **resolved
   2026-07-13**. See the User Hierarchy / Authorization Flow sections
   above and
   `context/feature-specs/architecture-Migration-Super-Admin-Administration-Implementation-Plan.md`
   for the full implementation: `userType`-discriminated `CurrentUser`,
   proxy-level PLATFORM/COMPANY route separation, per-company Roles, the
   `/administration` module, and the rewritten Company Creation workflow.
6. **`SystemContext` (`src/lib/system-context.ts`) is the standard for new
   code, not retrofitted onto the ~15 pre-migration services** that still
   call `getCurrentUser()`/`getCurrentCompanyUser()` directly
   (bank-accounts, ledgers, ledger-groups, financial-year,
   company-settings, users, roles, permissions, profile). Those primitives
   are already per-request `cache()`-deduped, so this is a pure
   consistency/readability cleanup, not a correctness gap — tracked as a
   follow-up, not silently dropped.

These are tracked as open follow-up work in `context/progress-tracker.md`
rather than implemented ad hoc inside an unrelated feature fix.

# Costing Strategy

Current Costing Method

- Latest Purchase Cost

Pricing Engine always uses the latest purchase cost for

- Selling Price Calculation
- Margin Calculation
- Inventory Valuation (Current Version)

**As of 95-purchase-price-sync.md (2026-09-22), "Latest Purchase Cost" is no
longer manual-entry-only.** `Product.purchasePrice` is automatically
updated whenever a Purchase Invoice is posted or a Purchase Order is
confirmed (whichever happens most recently wins), using the net-of-discount
effective unit cost (`taxableAmount / quantity`) of the winning line per
product. Every change is recorded in an append-only
`ProductPurchasePriceHistory` trail (source document, old/new value, actor,
timestamp) — a per-product *price-change audit trail*, not a per-movement
cost layer; it is not, and must not become, the data source for any future
FIFO/Weighted-Average implementation (see Future versions below). The
product form's manual edit path is unchanged and still works — this is an
additional automatic write path, not a replacement. Applies prospectively
only: purchase documents posted/confirmed before this feature shipped were
not backfilled.

Future versions may support

- FIFO
- Weighted Average
- Standard Cost
