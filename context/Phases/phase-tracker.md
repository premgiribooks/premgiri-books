# Phase 1 — Platform Foundation

Goal

Build the reusable ERP platform before implementing business modules.

## Accounting Foundation

✅ Completed — Ledger Groups (#12, `context/feature-specs/13-ledger-groups.md`) implemented 2026-07-13. Ledger Master (#13, `context/feature-specs/14-ledger-master.md`) implemented 2026-07-13. Bank Management (#14, `context/feature-specs/15-bank-management.md`) implemented 2026-07-13. Expense Heads (#15, `context/feature-specs/16-expense-heads.md`) implemented 2026-07-14. Income Heads (#16, `context/feature-specs/17-income-heads.md`) implemented 2026-07-14.

| #   | Feature         | Depends On          | Status |

| 15  | Expense Heads   | Ledger Master       | ✅     |
| 16  | Income Heads    | Ledger Master       | ✅     |

## Inventory Masters

✅ Completed — Unit Management (#17, `context/feature-specs/19-unit-management.md` — spec file number 19 because 18 was already taken) implemented 2026-07-14. Category Management (#18, `context/feature-specs/20-category-management.md`) implemented 2026-07-15. Brand Management (#19, `context/feature-specs/21-brand-management.md`) implemented 2026-07-15. HSN Management (#20, `context/feature-specs/22-hsn-management.md`) implemented 2026-07-15. GST Rate Management (#21, `context/feature-specs/23-gst-rate-management.md`) implemented 2026-07-15. Warehouse Management (#22, `context/feature-specs/24-warehouse-management.md`) implemented 2026-07-18 — with the optional branch link only, since Branch Management (feature-spec 12) remains unimplemented (see the Phase 1 note). Product Management (#23, `context/feature-specs/25-product-management.md`) implemented 2026-07-18, closing the group.

Feature-specs for the remaining six items were all drafted 2026-07-14 (spec-file numbers are sequential and never reused, so tracker numbers and spec-file numbers diverge from here on — each spec records its own mapping):

| Tracker # | Feature              | Spec file                                         |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 18        | Category Management  | `context/feature-specs/20-category-management.md` |
| 19        | Brand Management     | `context/feature-specs/21-brand-management.md`    |
| 20        | HSN Management       | `context/feature-specs/22-hsn-management.md`      |
| 21        | GST Rate Management  | `context/feature-specs/23-gst-rate-management.md` |
| 22        | Warehouse Management | `context/feature-specs/24-warehouse-management.md` |
| 23        | Product Management   | `context/feature-specs/25-product-management.md`  |

| #   | Feature              | Depends On                                          | Status |
| --- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 17  | Unit Management      | Database Foundation                                 | ✅     |
| 18  | Category Management  | Database Foundation                                 | ✅     |
| 19  | Brand Management     | Database Foundation                                 | ✅     |
| 20  | HSN Management       | Database Foundation                                 | ✅     |
| 21  | GST Rate Management  | Database Foundation                                 | ✅     |
| 22  | Warehouse Management | Company + Branch (see the Branch note in spec 24)   | ✅     |
| 23  | Product Management   | Categories + Brands + Units + GST + HSN + Warehouse | ✅     |

---

## Business Parties

Feature-specs for both items were drafted 2026-07-18. Customer Management (#24) was
implemented 2026-07-19 (git branch `new-features`); Supplier Management (#25) was
implemented later the same day (git branch `26-customer-manage`), closing this group.
Spec-file numbers are sequential and never reused, so they diverge from tracker numbers:

| Tracker # | Feature             | Spec file                                          |
| --------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 24        | Customer Management | `context/feature-specs/26-customer-management.md`  |
| 25        | Supplier Management | `context/feature-specs/27-supplier-management.md`  |

| #   | Feature             | Depends On    | Status |
| --- | ------------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| 24  | Customer Management | Ledger Master | ✅     |
| 25  | Supplier Management | Ledger Master | ✅     |

---

## Pricing

Feature-specs for all three items were drafted 2026-07-18 (not yet implemented).
Implementation order within the group: #26 → #27 → #28 (each spec depends on the prior;
the Pricing Engine additionally requires Customer Management #24 to be implemented
first, for `Customer.priceListId`):

| Tracker # | Feature         | Spec file                                          |
| --------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 26        | Margin Profiles | `context/feature-specs/28-margin-profiles.md`      |
| 27        | Price Lists     | `context/feature-specs/29-price-lists.md`          |
| 28        | Pricing Engine  | `context/feature-specs/30-pricing-engine.md`       |

| #   | Feature         | Depends On                         | Status |
| --- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------ |
| 26  | Margin Profiles | Product Management                 | ✅     |
| 27  | Price Lists     | Margin Profiles                    | ✅     |
| 28  | Pricing Engine  | Products + Customers + Price Lists | ✅     |

## Shared ERP Engines

Feature-specs for all four items were drafted 2026-07-18. All four are now implemented
(2026-07-19): Document Number Engine (#32), Voucher Engine (#29), Inventory Engine (#30),
and GST Engine (#31) — the last to land, independent of the other three. Specs 31 and 34
deliberately exclude the branch dimension while Branch Management (feature-spec 12)
remains unimplemented — each records a forward-note migration:

| Tracker # | Feature                | Spec file                                              |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 29        | Voucher Engine         | `context/feature-specs/31-voucher-engine.md`           |
| 30        | Inventory Engine       | `context/feature-specs/32-inventory-engine.md`         |
| 31        | GST Engine             | `context/feature-specs/33-gst-engine.md`               |
| 32        | Document Number Engine | `context/feature-specs/34-document-number-engine.md`   |

| #   | Feature                | Depends On                                          | Status |

| 30  | Inventory Engine       | Products + Warehouse                                | ✅     |
| 31  | GST Engine             | GST Rates + HSN                                     | ✅     |
| 32  | Document Number Engine | Company + Financial Year (branch dimension deferred — see spec 34) | ✅     |

Phase Status

🟨 In Progress — Quotations (#33, feature-spec 35) implemented 2026-09-10, the first of seven Phase 3 documents. Establishes the `/sales` hub and the shared header/line-item/engine-composition conventions specs 36–41 reuse. "Convert to Sales Order" is deliberately NOT part of #33 — it is Sales Orders' (#34) own entry point once that spec is implemented; see `context/progress-tracker.md`'s Completed entry for the full forward-note record.

# Current Feature

**Next Feature to Implement**

➡ **34 - Sales Orders** (Phase 3 — Sales Management) — spec drafted 2026-07-19 as `context/feature-specs/36-sales-orders.md`. **#33 Quotations was implemented 2026-09-10** (git branch `35-quotations`; see `context/progress-tracker.md`'s Completed entry), the first of the seven Phase 3 documents and the establishing spec for the chain's shared header/line-item shape. Sales Orders is next in the documented conversion chain (Quotation → Sales Order → Delivery Challan → Sales Invoice) and is also what closes the "Convert to Sales Order" gap Quotations deliberately deferred. Phase 1/2 are both fully complete (Branch Management, #11, implemented 2026-09-10 — see the Phase 1 status-discrepancy note above, now resolved). Per `ai-workflow-rules.md` only one feature is worked at a time and the next feature awaits explicit user direction.

# Notes

- Complete one feature at a time.
- Never skip dependencies.
- Each completed feature should update this tracker.
- Every feature must pass TypeScript, ESLint, and build verification before being marked complete.
